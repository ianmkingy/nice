Notes for Solution.
Stemming frequency for given word/input string.
Due to time and non-use of libraries, I opted to build a simple stemming method to remove suffixes for the known given words & input string.
A simple method to parse the input string into an array.
A method to compare the stem of the given word with the stem of each word in the array to count the frequency

Unit tests for the Stemming and Counting Methods to prove the acceptance criteria.
A simple GUI to display/prove the working of the methods
